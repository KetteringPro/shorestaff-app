# SwipeAShift Worker Agreement

## Non-Solicitation Agreement
By using the SwipeAShift platform, I agree that:
- I will not accept any direct employment, contract, or shift offers outside of SwipeAShift from a restaurant, client, or venue I have been introduced to or worked for through the platform for a period of **twelve (12) months** following my most recent shift with that client, unless I have obtained written authorization from SwipeAShift.  
- If a restaurant wishes to hire me directly, they must go through the SwipeAShift **Worker Conversion** process and pay the applicable conversion fee.  
- I acknowledge that this policy protects both SwipeAShift and its community by ensuring fair compensation for the services that make these connections possible.

## Code of Conduct
- I will show up on time and prepared for all shifts.  
- I will communicate promptly if I cannot attend a confirmed shift.  
- I will maintain professionalism while representing SwipeAShift.  
- I understand that no-shows result in permanent removal from the platform.

**Acknowledgment:**  
By proceeding, I confirm I have read and agree to the SwipeAShift Worker Agreement.
