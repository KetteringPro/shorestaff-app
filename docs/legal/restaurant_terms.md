# SwipeAShift Restaurant Terms of Service

## Non-Solicitation & Worker Conversion Policy
SwipeAShift invests in recruiting, screening, verifying, and maintaining a network of qualified hospitality professionals.  

To protect this investment, the client agrees:
- Not to directly solicit, employ, or contract with any SwipeAShift worker outside the platform for a period of **twelve (12) months** after their most recent shift with the client.  
- If the client wishes to employ or contract directly with a worker, they may do so through the **SwipeAShift Worker Conversion Program** by paying a one-time fee equal to **$500 or 10% of the workerâ€™s estimated annual compensation (whichever is greater)**.  
- Once the fee is paid, SwipeAShift will release the worker from the non-solicitation restriction for that client.  
- Attempts to circumvent this policy may result in suspension from the platform and recovery of damages.

**Acknowledgment:**  
By continuing, the client confirms agreement to the SwipeAShift Terms of Service.
